ðŸš§ **The code is currently being organized and will be released soon. Stay tuned!**

Currently, we only provide the core plug-and-play Wavelet Scattering Module (WSM).  
Codes for integrating this module into other models for classification and generation tasks,  
as well as pretrained weights, will be uploaded gradually in the future.

Transformers have demonstrated strong global modeling capabilities in vision tasks, but their lack of inherent inductive
biases often limits their ability to capture fine-grained and stable local structures. To address this limitation, we propose a
lightweight and flexible Wavelet Scattering Module (WSM)
that can be seamlessly integrated into Transformer-based vision architectures to enhance local feature modeling. Specifically, we first design a novel method to extract compact and
interpretable frequency-domain features, allowing the input
image to be partitioned into adjustable local regions, and extracting mean, standard deviation, and significant energy for
each region. Furthermore, we design an efficient multi-modal
feature fusion strategy that combines the extracted scattering
features with visual features without introducing additional
trainable parameters.
